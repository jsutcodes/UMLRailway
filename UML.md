// A relationship is a general term covering the specific types of logical connections found on class and object diagrams. UML defines the following relationships:
// solid flat line with arrow -> Association
// solid flat line with triangle -|> Inheritance
// dotted line with triangle --|> Realization/Implememntation
// dotted line with arrow --> Dependency
// clear diamond with solid line <>- agregation
// solid diamond with slid lines <filled> - Composition

// Multiplicity:
//        0	No instances (rare)
//        0..1	No instances, or one instance
//        1	Exactly one instance
//        1..1	Exactly one instance
//        0..*	Zero or more instances
//        *	Zero or more instances
//        1..*	One or more instances
